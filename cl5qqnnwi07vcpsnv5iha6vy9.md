## What is cloud-native? What to know for your interview

Cloud-native technologies have turned into a significant piece of present-day programming improvement. Cloud-Native engineering permits us to deal with abrupt floods sought after in a coordinated and productive manner using holders, microservices, DevOps, and APIs. With cloud occupations in such popularity, you can assist with separating yourself from the opposition by creating solid cloud abilities.

In this article, we'll investigate the term cloud-local and examine the advantages of cloud-local design, how to fabricate a cloud-local application, and what to be aware of for your cloud interviews.

## What is cloud-native?

Cloud-native is a way to deal with application improvement that utilizes the distributed computing conveyance model. Cloud-Native improvement was intended to upgrade current application advancement by utilizing the adaptability, strength, and adaptability that the cloud gives.

As characterized by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), "cloud-native advancements engage associations to construct and run adaptable applications in the present day, dynamic conditions like public, private, and hybrid Clouds."

> Note: The CNCF was created by the Linux Foundation in 2015. It’s an open-source software foundation that promotes cloud-native technologies. Companies like Microsoft, Oracle, and Intel are members of the foundation. They support open-source projects such as Kubernetes, Envoy, and many more.

Cloud-native app development leverages things like containerization, service meshes, declarative APIs, and microservices to allow you to build, deploy, and manage high-impact cloud-native applications. Cloud-native services use technologies such as Docker, Kafka, Kubernetes, and serverless functions to help you efficiently build and run scalable applications in private and public cloud environments.


## Cloud-native architecture

Cloud-native architecture focuses on designing apps or services that were made to exist in the cloud rather than on-premises infrastructure. The cloud-native architecture enables us to create and deploy applications that are easy to maintain and have flexibility without relying on physical servers.

**Microservices** and serverless functions are very important in cloud-native architectures. Microservices are one of the main parts of cloud-native app architecture. Many companies use them because they support DevOps, improve scalability, reduce costs, and enable flexibility.

Microservices and containerization support cloud-native apps by enabling us to switch between cloud providers, deploy services independently, and deploy services in different languages or frameworks without issues. There are many benefits to implementing a cloud-native architecture into your application development process. Let’s take a look at some of the benefits and challenges:


Benefits

-  Continuous integration: Microservices help us with continuous integration and continuous delivery efforts because the development lifecycle is reduced and more processes are automated.

- Container orchestration: Container orchestrators can schedule and allocate resources based on user needs. Open-source container orchestration platforms help us identify bugs in specific containers so we can find the root of the problem instead of affecting the entire application.

- Portability: Containerized microservices are very portable, which means we don’t need to rely too much on one specific cloud provider.

- Reduced downtime: Container orchestrators help us deploy software updates with less downtime.

- Fast development time: Cloud-native architecture helps us speed up the app development process for organizations that have to compute resources spread across different environments. This also allows us to get more value from the hybrid cloud.

Challenges

- **Lack of DevOps**: If your organization doesn’t establish a DevOps pipeline, it may be difficult to manage the distributed workflows and microservices within your application.

- **Microservices**: Certain microservices are dependent on specific types of operating systems, so make sure to consider that before moving forward.

- ** Dependencies:** If you transition from a traditional application to a cloud-native application, dependencies and interdependencies may arise.

## Cloud-native vs traditional applications

Traditional apps are basic apps that run on a mainframe environment or that have a client/server environment. Cloud-native apps implement the cloud computing delivery model to improve the app development process.

Let’s take a look at some of the main differences between cloud-native apps and traditional apps:

### Cloud-native

- **Predictable:** Cloud-native apps follow a framework that helps optimize resiliency through predictable actions. Cloud platforms use an automated, container-driven infrastructure that drives the way we write our software.

- **Collaborative:** Since cloud-native architecture uses DevOps, the app development process is more streamlined.

- **Practical capacity:** Cloud-native app development automates infrastructure provisioning, which helps allocate the appropriate resources at the time of deployment.

- **Independent:** The microservices architecture breaks apps into smaller services. This makes it easier to perform updates and scales the services without affecting other aspects of the application.

- **Continuous delivery**: Individual updates can be released as soon as they’re ready.

- **Operating system abstraction: ** The cloud-native architecture allows us to break away from underlying infrastructure dependencies and focus on the software.

### Traditional

- **Not predictable:** Traditional apps are developed in specific ways, and they don’t use the benefits of the cloud computing delivery model. This means that traditional apps may take longer to build, and they may have more infrequent releases.

- **Isolated:** Traditional app development doesn’t use DevOps, so there’s typically less collaboration between different teams.

- **Large capacity:** Custom infrastructure solutions may delay app deployment due to their oversized capacity.

- **Dependent: **The monolithic architectures bundle services into single packages, which causes dependencies between services. This can affect updates and scale.

- **Delayed delivery:** Updates may be delayed, which affects the performance of the application.
Operating system dependency: Traditional app development typically involves dependencies between the application itself and its underlying operating system.

### How to build a cloud-native application
There are many different tools and practices we can use when building and operating cloud-native applications. Let’s take a look at some of the fundamentals:


### DevOps
DevOps is a combination of philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver apps and services quickly and efficiently. DevOps allows us to fully use the native cloud capabilities and ensures that dev and operations teams work together with regular communication and common goals. With DevOps, our software development processes and more consistent and efficient.


### Microservices
Microservices architecture involves developing applications as collections of smaller services. Each microservice can be manipulated independently of other services within the same application. This enables a more streamlined application development lifecycle without negatively impacting users.


### Continuous delivery
Continuous delivery is made possible by Agile development practices. It means that we constantly make phased software changes through automation. It’s a very reliable way to release and deliver software more frequently and safely.


### APIs
Since cloud-native applications rely heavily on microservices, we need a well-defined way for these separate services to communicate with each other. This is where APIs come in. Application programming interfaces (APIs) connect products and services and allow them to easily communicate so we can maximize the development process.


### Containerization
Using containers gives us more efficiency and speed compared to traditional virtual machines. With containerization, a single operating system instance is divided across one or more containers, which allows us to create and deploy individual microservices.
