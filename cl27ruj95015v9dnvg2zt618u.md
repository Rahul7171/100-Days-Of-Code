### What are web frameworks?
Like other major programming languages, Python employs software platforms unique to it called web frameworks. Web frameworks act as the premade skeleton of a website because developers, both front-end and back-end, do not want to spend tedious time reinventing the wheel. Frameworks help minimize the number of tasks involved with launching a website.

These tasks can include:

- Security and authorization
- Database connection
- User authentication
- Application templates
- Browser systems

### What is Flask?
Flask is classified as a lightweight microframework. The name is fitting because Flask features only provide the essential functions for setting up your website.
These functions include:

- URL routing
- Cookies
- Debugging
- Templates
- Development servers

### Flask: Advantages and disadvantages
Flask is simple, straightforward, and provides developers with plenty of room for **flexibility regarding design and website architecture.** Scaling up a web application to include more complex operations is left in the hands of the developer, not the software. Flask grants developers absolute control over what features are implemented into their websites as the framework does not enforce any fixed layouts, applications, or tools. It may be a bit unfinished, but that leaves more room for your design creativity to flourish.

Only one task can be processed at a time due to Flask’s minimalistic tools and single sourcing. Third-party modules (web applications and tools) can be added to Flask to scale up the complexity and increase functionality. Adding these modules will open the site to potential security risks, but never fear, APIs are here. Among other features, an application programming interface (API) will add an extra blanket of security between your server and data.

### Advantages:

- Great for beginners
- Simple and lightweight framework
- Flexible options for creativity with web apps
- More control over the structure
- Easier to test units and functions
- Thorough documentation

### Disadvantages:

- Singular source makes it difficult to scale
- Third-party modules can pose a security risk
- Libraries must be manually installed

### What is Django?
The Django framework can be described as the overachieving older sibling of Flask. There is a steeper learning curve, but the payoff is well worth the extra effort. The software was named after the famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, not the Jamie Foxx character that many of you are probably thinking about.

Django is a complete and complex framework that comes fully equipped with nearly all the applications a website would need, hence the “batteries-included” nickname.


### Django: Advantages and disadvantages
A Django project is typically a much more finished product. The framework is renowned for **handling complex features, rapid development, and user traffic**. This allows you, as the developer, to spend more time creating advanced applications for your site. Django is also the best option for a website with cross-site scripting, complex features, and heavy user traffic. With Django, any action or application you need from your website can be easily achieved. Be forewarned, with great power comes great responsibility, as it **requires a skilled developer** to master the larger codebase. You must learn to walk before you learn to use Django.

### Advantages:

- Speed and scalability (less need for added modules)
- Preset security features (APIs)
- Versatility

### Disadvantages:

- Not ideal for smaller, more straightforward projects
- An abundance of functions and resources can lead to a slow and overworked website
- Developers need a high level of expertise to navigate Django
