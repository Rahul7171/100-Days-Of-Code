## What is Open Source Software?

Open source software is a type of computer software in which the source code is made available under a license that allows users to freely use, modify, redistribute, and contribute. Open source software is typically developed collaboratively, so anyone who wishes to contribute can do so by submitting a submission or suggesting changes.

Open source software is a vital component of the technological world. If you're new to computer programming or want to start contributing to open source, you've come to the right place. Today, we'll go over an introduction to open source and show you how to get involved.

##  What is open source software?

The term "open source" was introduced by the Open Source Initiative in the 1990s. Open source software refers to public source code that users can freely access or modify by providing peer-reviewed suggestions or fixes Open sources software such as frameworks and libraries can also be reused in other programs and most programming languages ​​are open source This is in direct contrast to proprietary or closed source software where the source code is owned solely by an organization of is and is operated by it. 

The authors of proprietary software decide whether a program is an open source or not. In the case of closed source, a user with proprietary license rights must be allowed to modify the source code. Adobe Photoshop or  Google Cloud, for example, do not grant permission to third-party developers to use or modify this code. Open source, on the other hand, makes the source code available to the public and can be modified once the user agrees to the terms of a license. It is important to note that there is a difference between open source software and free source software. 

The open-source software puts much more emphasis on security and licensing. Free source software is considered open source, but open source software is not necessarily free. Some developers charge money for software or software support (e.g. installation, troubleshooting).

### Popular open source software licenses and technologies

GNU General Public License: any source code written under this license must be released as open source.

- **Apache License 2.0:** If you issue an Apache license, you can run, modify, and share software code for free as long as it follows the Apache licensing rules.

- **MIT license: ** There are no restrictions to the MIT license, and it can be re-licensed under other licenses.

- **Swift programming language:** Apple created this replacement to Objective C and released it as an open source technology.

- **Kubernetes:** This DevOps technology popularized the use of container orchestration using open source principles.

- **Flutter**: Google’s open source solution to building native UIs has made it easier for developers everywhere to make amazing applications.

- **TensorFlow:** This end-to-end open source platform is now an essential part of the machine learning toolkit. It was the work of the community that made this software useful.

- **Linux:** This open source platform is what gave us global web searching and access to OS technologies.

- **Android:** This operating system is popular due to its open-source nature, opening up access to Google services.

## Why is open source important? 

Open source software is very important in the history of software development. We wouldn't be where we are today without open-source software. The term was instituted explicitly for programming advancement, truth be told. Open source is a set of values ​​that celebrate open sharing and participation. These licenses democratize the world of programming. 

Open source software sets the precedent that profit and profit are not the primary goals of programming: global collaboration and problem-solving are. Some argue that the Internet would be very different today without open source software. Source software (Linux and Apache web server) so that the common information values ​​were built into the foundation. 

This is changing our relationship with technology by encouraging human connection and collaboration. learn a new programming language, and benefit from the values ​​of open source. Open source plays an active role in solving human problems and improving the world,  believing that this can possibly occur assuming that everybody approaches the arrangement. The underlying code of our world needs to be in the hands of anyone who wants to improve it.

## Why should you contribute to open source?

Alright, so we understand what open source is, and we realize the reason why it's significant. As a developer perusing this article, you may now be pondering "yet for what reason would it be advisable for me I contribute?" Let's investigate a portion of the significant reasons:

### Gain real-world experience

If you're a beginner programmer and need to get hands-on revel in the software program improvement lifecycle, you may do it by contributing to the open supply initiatives. These initiatives are maintained withinside a comparable way (or every so often even better) than closed supply initiatives due to the fact there are such a lot of humans actively contributing. You’ll study the whole thing approximately Git flow, Issue tracking, Code reviews, and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

### Earn recognition

Working with open source helps you present yourself as an expert in your field, even without professional experience. Many developers include open source contributions on their resumes. There are even many organizations that pay you. Familiar with your code base and workflow so you can differentiate yourself as a candidate by contributing to your projects.


### Technical upskilling

Working with open source will make you more tech-savvy and experienced. Usually, when you develop something you only think about a limited group of users, but when you develop open-source software you know that thousands of people will be using it. That means you pay more attention to detail. Also, there is a peer review process to weed out bad practices, which will help you become a better programmer.

### Give back to the community

You benefit from the open source whether you know it or not. By contributing, you can give back to the community what you have learned. Developers who contribute to open source are why we have the types of technology we have today. Usually, open source groups have local communities hosting events, so you even have the opportunity to network with local tech circles.

### Key open source terms to know

There are some common terms used in the open source world that you need to be successful. Let’s take a look to get up to speed.

- **Maintainers: **these are the engineers that build and manage open source projects
Repository: where the codebase is stored. This is where you’ll find the history and progress of a given project stored in files

- **Issue:** an enhancement or fixed error in the source code. Contributors work on resolving issues.
Fork: creates a copy of a repository under your username. This is used to make changes in code when you are working on an issue.

- **Commit:** the saved version of code that is organized by commit messages. This is how we track the changes made to code and know which version is the most recent

- **Pull request (PR):** a submission of your changes to a forked repository to the original. This is the preferred way to make contributions once they are peer-reviewed and merged

- **Merge:** imports suggested PRs to the original open source repository. This is done by the maintainer

- **Git:** a version control system where we can save versions of code. Think of this as a storage unit or bank

- **GitHub:** a most popular site for hosting Git repositories

## How do you get started?

### Step 1: Gather your ideas and skills

Before getting started, ask yourself what project you want to work on. Start with the programming languages you know well. What frameworks do you like best? What problems have you encountered while using them?

Once you specify the language you want to work on, you should narrow down a project. GitHub organizes projects into Showcases, where you can browse for a topic. From there, analyze the volume of that project. If you’re new, it’s not a great idea to jump into large software projects. Some projects are even labeled “first-timers-only” or “easy”.


### Step 2: Familiarize yourself with GitHub and Git

GitHub is the most popular, widely used hosting platform for open source projects. If you don’t have one already, you’ll need to create an account. Read their guide to get familiar with the platform. You’ll also need to get familiar with Git. The basic skills you’ll need to learn are:

- Cloning a repository
- Sending pull requests (PRs)
- Reviewing changes
- Discussing changes
- Assigning commits

### Step 3: Join a community that suits you

Open source projects are welcoming to incomers. Once you find a project you like and learned the basics of GitHub/Git, join a community that suits you and start contributing. The easiest way to join is to subscribe to the mailing list for a project. These are usually listed on GitHub pages. You’ll then be accepted to the team and can start communicating with the members.


### Step 4: Mentor others

Once you become a member and a seasoned contributor, it’s time to give back to others. The key to open source is collaboration, so being helpful and welcoming to newcomers is part of your responsibility as a contributor. Reply to questions, guide folks through projects, and share your knowledge freely.

> Note: You can also create your own projects from scratch if you feel that existing projects don’t offer the solutions you want. You’ll need to create an initial project draft that answers a set of basic questions.

> Another common way that people start their own projects is by developing open source alternatives to commercialized software. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel to be a valuable contributor.

## Notable open source competitions:

Many developers get started with open source through online programming competitions. These coding competitions are usually organized by known tech companies, so you gain experience and recognition. Here are some of the notable competitions:

- **Hacktoberfest:** Hacktoberfest is an online event organized by Digital Ocean during October of each year. You need to contribute to the Open Source projects with at least 4 merged PRs. If you are not clear about how to contribute to the actual codebase, you can also contribute to improving their docs.

- **Google Summer of Code**: The Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an international annual program in which Google awards stipends to students who successfully complete a free and open source software coding project during the summer.

- **IBM’s Call for Code: **The Call for Code Global Challenge is a chance to work on solving challenges through code and software solutions. It’s also supported by Charitable Partner United Nations Human Rights. Together with The Linux Foundation, top solutions are open-sourced and deployed.

- **Microsoft Imagine Cup:** Imagine Cup is an annual competition sponsored and hosted by Microsoft. It brings together student developers worldwide to help resolve some of the world’s toughest challenges.

- **Facebook Hacker Cup:** Facebook Hacker Cup is an annual international competition, which started as a way to identify top engineering talent for employment at Facebook.
