## What is a quantum computer?

**What is a quantum computer?**

Quantum computers are machines that use the properties of [quantum physics](https://www.newscientist.com/definition/quantum-physics/) to store data and perform computations. This can be extremely advantageous for certain tasks where they could vastly outperform even our best supercomputers.

[Classical computers, which include smartphones and laptops, encode information in binary “bits” that can either be 0s or 1s. In a](https://www.newscientist.com/question/what-is-a-quantum-computer/#ixzz7AHqIIGZ9) [quantum computer](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23631500-600-the-problem-with-the-ultimate-problemsolving-machine/), the basic unit of memory is a quantum bit or qubit.

Qubits are made using physical systems, such as the spin of an electron or the orientation of a photon. These systems can be in many different arrangements all at once, a property known as quantum [superposition](https://www.newscientist.com/definition/schrodingers-cat/). Qubits can also be inextricably linked together using a phenomenon called [quantum entanglement](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24332470-500-what-is-space-time-the-true-origins-of-the-fabric-of-reality/). The result is that a series of qubits can represent different things simultaneously.

For instance, eight bits is enough for a classical computer to represent any number between 0 and 255. But eight qubits is enough for a quantum computer to represent every number between 0 and 255 at the same time. A few hundred entangled qubits would be enough to represent more numbers than there are atoms in the universe.

This is where quantum computers get their edge over classical ones. In situations where there are a large number of possible combinations, quantum computers can consider them simultaneously. Examples include trying to find the prime factors of a very large number or the best route between two places.

However, there may also be plenty of situations where classical computers will still outperform quantum ones. So the computers of the future may be a combination of both these types.

For now, quantum computers are highly sensitive: heat, electromagnetic fields, and collisions with air molecules can cause a qubit to lose its quantum properties. This process, known as quantum decoherence, causes the system to crash, and it happens more quickly the more particles that are involved.

Quantum computers need to protect qubits from external interference, either by physically isolating them, [keeping them cool](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130210-nanofridge-could-keep-quantum-computers-cool-enough-to-calculate/), or zapping them with carefully controlled pulses of energy. Additional qubits are needed to correct for errors that creep into the system.

**What can a quantum computer do?**

A quantum computer isn’t a supercomputer that can do everything faster, but there are a few areas where quantum computers do exceptionally well.

**Quantum simulation:**

Since quantum computers use quantum phenomena in computation, they are well suited for modeling other quantum systems. Photosynthesis, superconductivity, and complex molecular formations are examples of quantum mechanisms that quantum programs can simulate. In 1994,

**Search and Grover’s algorithm:**

In 1996, Lov Grover developed a quantum algorithm that dramatically sped up the solution to unstructured data searches, running the search in fewer steps than any classical algorithm could.

**Cryptography and Shor’s algorithm:**

In 1994, Peter Shor showed that a scalable quantum computer could break widely used encryption techniques such as the RSA algorithm. Classical cryptography relies on the intractability of problems such as integer factorization or discrete logarithms, many of which can be solved more efficiently using quantum computers.

**Quantum-inspired computing and optimization:**

Machine learning on classical computers is revolutionizing the world of science and business. However, the high computational cost of training the models hinders the development and scope of the field. The area of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement quantum software that enables machine learning that runs faster than classical computers.

The Quantum Development Kit comes with the [quantum machine learning library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/quantum/user-guide/libraries/machine-learning/) that gives you the ability to run hybrid quantum/classical machine learning experiments. The library includes samples and tutorials and provides the necessary tools to implement a new hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, the circuit-centric quantum classifier, to solve supervised classification problems.

**what is Qubit?**

Just like a binary bit is the basic unit of information in classical (or traditional) computing, a qubit (or quantum bit) is the basic unit of information in quantum computing. Quantum computing is driving discoveries in healthcare, energy, environmental systems, smart materials, and beyond.

**Qubit vs bit**

Qubits are represented by a superposition of multiple possible states

A qubit uses the quantum mechanical phenomena of superposition to achieve a linear combination of two states. A classical binary bit can only represent a single binary value, such as 0 or 1, meaning that it can only be in one of two possible states. A qubit, however, can represent a 0, a 1, or any proportion of 0 and 1 in a superposition of both states, with a certain probability of being a 0 and a certain probability of being a 1.

Superposition gives quantum computers superior computing power

Superposition allows quantum algorithms to process information in a fraction of the time it would take even the fastest classical systems to solve certain problems.

*   The amount of information a qubit system can represent grows exponentially. Information that 500 qubits can easily represent would not be possible with even more than 2⁵⁰⁰ classical bits.
*   It would take classical computers millions of years to find the prime factors of a 2,048-bit number. Qubits could perform the calculation in just minutes.

There are many physical implementations of qubits

Where classical computers use familiar silicon-based chips, qubits (sometimes called “quantum computer qubits”) can be made from trapped ions, photons, artificial or real atoms, or quasiparticles. Depending on the architecture and qubit systems, some implementations need their qubits to be kept at temperatures close to absolute zero.

Superposition, interference, and entanglement

Superposition enables quantum algorithms to utilize other quantum mechanical phenomena, such as interference and entanglement. Together, superposition, interference, and entanglement create computing power that can solve problems exponentially faster than classical computers.

Interference

A consequence of superposition is interference. Qubit states can interfere with each other because each state is described by a probability amplitude, just like the amplitudes of waves.

Constructive interference enhances amplitude, while destructive interference cancels out amplitude. These effects are used in quantum computing algorithms, which make them fundamentally different from classical algorithms. Interference is used together with entanglement to enable the quantum acceleration promised by quantum computation.

Entanglement

Multiple qubits can exhibit quantum entanglement. Entangled qubits always correlate with each other to form a single system. Even when they are infinitely far apart, measuring the state of one of the qubits allows us to know the state of the other, without needing to measure it directly.

Entanglement is required for any quantum computation and it cannot be efficiently performed on a classical computer. Applications include factoring large numbers (Shor’s algorithm) and solving search problems (Grover’s algorithm).

**Conclusion**

Although tech marvels such as IBM and Microsoft are racing to fully uncover the potential of quantum computing, the usage of quantum computing is not very prominent today and only large multinational corporations are capable of leveraging its potential. This is because a huge capital is required to harness the power of quantum computing. So it is still a far dream for startups and medium-sized companies to use this powerful and futuristic technology
