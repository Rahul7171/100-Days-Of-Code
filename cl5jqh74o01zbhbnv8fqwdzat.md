## Why (and when) you should use Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a powerful container management tool that mechanizes the sending and the executives of holders. Kubernetes (k8's) is the following enormous wave in distributed computing and it's not difficult to see the reason why as organizations relocate their foundation and engineering to mirror a cloud-Native, information-driven period.

Whether you're a Developer, Data Scientist, Product Manager, or something different, it won't damage to have a little Kubernetes information in your back pocket. It's one of the most sought-after abilities by organizations, everything being equal, so assuming that you're hoping to acquire another expertise that will remain with you all through your vocation, then learning Kubernetes is an extraordinary choice.

## Container orchestration

 Container are perfect. They give you a simple method for bundling and conveying administrations, consider process disengagement, unchanging nature, effective asset usage, and are lightweight in creation.

Yet, with regards to really running holders underway, you can wind up with handfuls, even a huge number of compartments over the long run. These compartments should be conveyed, made due, associated, and refreshed; if you somehow happened to do this physically, you'd require a whole group devoted to this.

It's adequately not to run holders; you should have the option to:

- Coordinate and arrange these secluded parts
- Increase and scale down in light of the interest
- Make them issue lenient
- Give correspondence across a bunch

You could inquire: aren't holders expected to do all that? The response is those holders are just low-level pieces of the riddle. The genuine advantages are acquired with devices that sit on top of holders — like Kubernetes. These apparatuses are today known as holder schedulers.


## Great for multi-cloud adoption

With a significant number of the present organizations equipped with microservice engineering, it's nothing unexpected that compartments and the devices used to oversee them have become so well known.

Microservice engineering makes it simple to part your application into more modest parts with holders that can then be run on various cloud conditions, giving you the choice to pick the best host for your requirements.

What's perfect about Kubernetes is that it's worked to be utilized anyplace so you can convey to public/private/crossover mists, empowering you to arrive at clients where they're at, with more noteworthy accessibility and security. You can perceive how Kubernetes can assist you with staying away from possible dangers with "seller secure".

## Deploy and update applications at scale for faster time-to-market

Kubernetes permits groups to stay up with the prerequisites of current programming advancement. Without Kubernetes, huge groups would need to prearrange their own organization work processes physically.

Holders, joined with a coordination instrument, give the executives of machines and administrations for you — working on the dependability of your application while decreasing how much time and assets are spent on DevOps.

Kubernetes has a few extraordinary highlights that permit you to send applications quicker considering versatility:

- **Flat framework scaling: **New servers can be added or eliminated without any problem.
Auto-scaling: Automatically change the quantity of running compartments, in view of CPU usage or other application-gave measurements.

-  **Manual scaling: **Manually scale the quantity of running holders through an order or the connection point.
Replication regulator: The replication regulator ensures your bunch has an equivalent measure of units running. In the event that there are such a large number of cases, the replication regulator ends the additional units. Assuming there are excessively scarcely any, it begins more units.

- **Wellbeing checks and self-mending:** Kubernetes can check the soundness of hubs and holders guaranteeing your application runs into no disappointments. Kubernetes likewise offers self-recuperating and auto-substitution so you don't have to stress over on the off chance that a holder or case comes up short.

- **Traffic directing and load adjusting**: Traffic steering sends solicitations to the fitting compartments. Kubernetes likewise accompanies worked in load balancers so you can adjust assets to answer blackouts or times of high traffic.

- **Robotized rollouts and rollbacks: **Kubernetes handles rollouts for new adaptations or updates without margin time while checking the compartments' wellbeing. On the off chance that the rollout goes poorly, it consequently moves back.

- **Canary Deployments:** Canary organizations empower you to test the new sending underway in lined up with the past form.

### Better management of your applications


Containers allow applications to be broken down into smaller parts which can then be managed through an orchestration tool like Kubernetes. This makes it easy to manage codebases and test specific inputs and outputs.

As mentioned earlier, Kubernetes has built-in features like self-healing and automated rollouts/rollbacks, effectively managing the containers for you.

To go even further, Kubernetes allows for declarative expressions of the desired state as opposed to an execution of a deployment script, meaning that a scheduler can monitor a cluster and perform actions whenever the actual state does not match the desired. You can think of schedulers as operators who are continually monitoring the system and fixing discrepancies between the desired and actual state.

### Overview/additional benefits

- You can use it to deploy your services, to roll out new releases without downtime, and to scale (or de-scale) those services.
- It is portable.
- It can run on a public or private cloud.
- It can run on-premise or in a hybrid environment.
- You can move a Kubernetes cluster from one hosting vendor to another without changing (almost) any of the deployment and management processes.
- Kubernetes can be easily extended to serve nearly any needs. You can choose which modules you’ll use, and you can develop additional features yourself and plug them in.
- Kubernetes will decide where to run something and how to maintain the state you specify.
- Kubernetes can place replicas of service on the most appropriate server, restart them when needed, replicate them, and scale them.
- Self-healing is a feature included in its design from the start. On the other hand, self-adaptation is coming soon as well.
- Zero-downtime deployments, fault tolerance, high availability, scaling, scheduling, and self-healing add significant value in Kubernetes.
- You can use it to mount volumes for stateful applications.
- It allows you to store confidential information as secrets.
- You can use it to validate the health of your services.
- It can load balance requests and monitor resources.
- It provides service discovery and easy access to logs.

## When you should use Kubernetes

### If your application uses a microservice architecture
If you have transitioned or are looking to transition to a microservice architecture then Kubernetes will suit you well because it’s likely you’re already using software like Docker to containerize your application.


### If you’re suffering from slow development and deployment
If you’re unable to meet customer demands due to slow development time, then Kubernetes might help. Rather than a team of developers spending their time wrapping their heads around the development and deployment lifecycle, Kubernetes (along with Docker) can effectively manage it for you so the team can spend their time on more meaningful work that gets products out the door.

### Lower infrastructure costs
Kubernetes uses an efficient resource management model at the container, pod, and cluster level, helping you lower cloud infrastructure costs by ensuring your clusters always have available resources for running applications.




## When you shouldn’t use Kubernetes

### Simple, lightweight applications
If your application makes use of a monolithic architecture it may be tough to see the real benefits of containers and the tool used to orchestrate them.

That’s because the very nature of a monolithic architecture is to have every piece of the application intertwined — from IO to the data processing to rendering, whereas containers are used to separate your application into individual components.


### Culture doesn’t reflect the changes ahead
Kubernetes notoriously has a steep learning curve, meaning you’ll be spending a good amount of time educating teams and addressing the challenges of a new solution, etc. If you don’t have a team that’s willing to experiment and take risks then it’s probably not the choice for you.
