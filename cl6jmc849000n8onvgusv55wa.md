## Is RPA developer a good career in 2022

RPA, or Robotic Process Automation. In my opinion, the definition lies 
more in terms of process automation and less than actual robots. But RPA is changing 
the software world much like physical robots have changed the world that we live in every 
day. For example, take a vending machine,   there's not a person standing there sorting 
all your money and bending the goods it's automated because it's a tedious task. Now RPA 
is doing the same thing in the software world for tedious repetitive tasks. But for things 
like IT, or even Business Process Management, RPA is not going to help and that's because 
these require more specialized skills.  

## What is a Robotic Process Automation (RPA)?

Robotic process Robotization( RPA), also known as software robotics, uses robotization technologies to mimic back-office tasks of mortal workers, similar as rooting data, filling in forms, moving lines, etc. It combines APIs and stoner interface( UI) relations to integrate and perform repetitious tasks between enterprise and productivity operations. By planting scripts that emulate mortal processes, RPA tools complete independent prosecution of colorful conditioning and deals across unconnected software systems.

This form of robotization uses rule-grounded software to perform business process conditioning at a high- volume, freeing up mortal coffers to prioritize more complex tasks. RPA enables CIOs and other decision-makers to accelerate their digital metamorphosis sweats and induce an advanced return on investment( ROI) from their hand, allowing its digital pool via RPA to shoulder more tedious and time-consuming tasks.

still, previous to espousing RPA technologies, associations should estimate their readiness to borrow by examining their data operation processes and data armature. RPA is dependent on high-quality data and strong data governance to be successful, and if the right rails(e.g. center of excellence, governance boards, proven guidelines) aren't in place, it'll not be suitable to meet the prospects of the business.
